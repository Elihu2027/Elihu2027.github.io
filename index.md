# CPCS 120 Lab Portfolio

My name is Elihu Peralta and this is my first year working with C++. I am eager to broaden my C++ knowledge by the time that I plan to graduate in 2027.

## Favorite Labs

## Lab #1 Part 1
This lab marked the beginning of my coding journey. I enjoyed this lab because I had a very good partner that helped me learn from her past experience coding in highschool while I made sure that she followed the Google C++ style rules. This lab built the basic knowledge that I needed to begin every single lab after that.

## Lab #5 Part 1
This lab was the time I told myself to stick to computer science because I can not just give up when this look rough or hard. My lab partner helped me to come to this realization because his hard work of him teaching himself was paying off and I hope to reach and surpass his proficiency in coding. While taking notes from C++.com I was not really grasping the ideal of if statements until this lab. 

## Lab #7 Part 1 and 2
This lab was one of my favorite labs because it was when I was with a lab partner that did not fully carry me during the lab but I was not taking all the responsibility. Lab 7 and 8 where the labs that contributed the most to my growth in computer science. My lab partner taught me to not be afraid to ask question because if I do not ask questions I will not grow in my knowledge of C++.
